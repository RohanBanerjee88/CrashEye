## Crash Eye

Crash Eye is a robust application designed to streamline crash detection, categorization, and resolution in software development cycles. It simplifies the process for developers by efficiently managing crash data and enabling swift issue resolution.

## Installation and Setup

To initiate the crash detection process:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohanBanerjee88/CrashEye.git
   ```

2. Run the provided shell scripts to install the required modules and initialize crash detection:
   ```bash
   cd crash-eye
   chmod +x req_modules_win.ps1
   ./req_modules_win.ps1
   ```

## Backend Setup

The backend features a dummy storage system for testing purposes. It captures and stores crash log files to simulate real-time crash scenarios.

## Frontend Usage

The frontend interface pulls data from MongoDB, categorized into three databases: `critical`, `fatal`, and `warning`. These categories are displayed under different tabs in the developer's UI for issue resolution.

## Resolving Issues

Developers can resolve issues directly from the UI by clicking the 'Resolve' button, which dynamically erases the corresponding crash data from the database, ensuring efficient data flow management.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Sample code snippet demonstrating crash resolution process
function resolveIssue(issueId) {
  // Call backend API to mark issue as resolved
  axios.post(`/resolve/${issueId}`)
    .then((response) => {
      // Update UI or perform actions after successful resolution
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error resolving issue:', error);
    });
}
```
